        "body": "Following up from #453 and my discussion with @gauravtiwari, and my article [Webpacker Lite: Why Fork Webpacker?](https://blog.shakacode.com/webpacker-lite-why-fork-webpacker-f0a7707fac92) and my fork [Webpacker Lite](https://github.com/shakacode/webpacker_lite).\r\n\r\nI'd like to get some consensus on merging in the differences of Webpacker Lite before doing any work on a PR.\r\n\r\n# YML file and LIVE \r\n\r\n**Webpacker**, from [installer file](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/lib/install/config/webpacker.yml):\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndevelopment:\r\n   public_output_path: packs\r\n   dev_server:\r\n     host: 0.0.0.0\r\n     port: 8080\r\n     https: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Webpacker Lite**, from [README](https://github.com/shakacode/webpacker_lite/blob/master/README.md):\r\n```yaml\r\ndevelopment:\r\n  <<: *default\r\n  # generated files for development, in /public/webpack/development\r\n  webpack_public_output_dir: webpack/development\r\n  \r\n  # Default is localhost:3500. You can specify the protocol if needed. Defaults to http://.\r\n  hot_reloading_host: localhost:3500\r\n  \r\n  # Developer note: considering removing this option so it can ONLY be turned by using an ENV value.\r\n  # Default is false, ENV 'HOT_RELOADING' will always override \r\n  hot_reloading_enabled_by_default: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Should we use host vs individual keys and nested (note, `host` should have been `hostname` in webpacker).\r\n2. We need an option regarding whether or not using the webpack-dev-server should be the default, so this can be overridden with an env value, like `HOT_RELOADING`\r\n3. I'm fine with `public_output_path` rather than `webpack_public_output_dir` so long as this is the full path within the public directory where the generated files go, minus the `/public` part.\r\n\r\n# Helper differences\r\n1. Putting minimal in the manifest.json, not putting in the port, host, etc. and putting this logic in the [Ruby helper](https://github.com/shakacode/webpacker_lite/blob/master/lib/webpacker_lite/helper.rb#L62). This minimizes the requirement on a custom Webpack config to the bare minimum mapping of bundle names to file names.\r\n2. [stylesheet_pack_tag uses the hot reload (webpack-dev-server)](https://github.com/shakacode/webpacker_lite/blob/master/lib/webpacker_lite/helper.rb#L56) to decide if CSS should be included because you can't hot reload extracted CSS.\r\n3. [Using the mtime in the FileLoader](https://github.com/shakacode/webpacker_lite/blob/master/lib/webpacker_lite/file_loader.rb#L12) to account for the chance of using hash in file names for static files, both dev and test env, and the need to get the latest files.\r\n\r\n"

Now that npm 5 provides the same functionality, I don't\nthink we actually need Yarn any more. And I don't feel like Rails needs to\nbend over backwards to provide both. Maybe there's some transition period,\nand that's fine, but ultimately, Rails should just pick the best default\nchoice and go with that. From my limited read on the situation, it seems\nlike npm 5 is ultimately going to be that choice, but interested in hearing\ndissenting opinions on that.\n\nOn Tue, Jun 6, 2017 at 4:38 PM, Javan Makhmali <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Big +1 for supporting npm in addition to yarn, but I think that\n> attempting to do so automatically is going too far.

Action View finds all partial templates named `posts/post` and uses the first match, which may be an ERB template.\r\n\r\nTo fix, change `JbuilderTemplate#_set_inline_partial` to call `_render_partial_with_options` when given a singular object, as it would for a collection. This ensures that `ActionView::Base#render` is called with the necessary template lookup options.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `ActionView::Base#render` doesn’t respect the `:handlers` option in Rails versions older than 4.0.0, so it’s not possible to fix this for Rails 3, which Jbuilder currently supports.\r\n\r\n/cc @jeremy"

        "body": "Assume two non-empty partials, one at `posts/_post.json.jbuilder` and the other at `posts/_post.html.erb`.\r\n\r\nThe following Jbuilder template unexpectedly results in an empty JSON object:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\njbuilder.post @post, partial: \"posts/post\", as: :post\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because, deep inside Jbuilder, `ActionView::Base#render` is called without the `:handlers` option. Action View finds all partial templates named `posts/post` and uses the first match, which may be an ERB template.\r\n\r\nTo fix, change `JbuilderTemplate#_set_inline_partial` to call `_render_partial_with_options` when given a singular object, as it would for a collection. This ensures that `ActionView::Base#render` is called with the necessary template lookup options.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `ActionView::Base#render` doesn’t respect the `:handlers` option in Rails versions older than 4.0.0, so it’s not possible to fix this for Rails 3, which Jbuilder currently supports.\r\n\r\n/cc @jeremy",

Action View finds all partial templates named `posts/post` and uses the first match, which may be an ERB template.\r\n\r\nTo fix, change `JbuilderTemplate#_set_inline_partial` to call `_render_partial_with_options` when given a singular object, as it would for a collection. This ensures that `ActionView::Base#render` is called with the necessary template lookup options.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `ActionView::Base#render` doesn’t respect the `:handlers` option in Rails versions older than 4.0.0, so it’s not possible to fix this for Rails 3, which Jbuilder currently supports.\r\n\r\n/cc @jeremy"
